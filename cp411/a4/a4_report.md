## Q1 Culling, Lighting, Shading (short_answer)
	
### Q1.1 Concepts of culling
1) Culling is a process of removing objects that aten't in frame. Clipping is the process in which the polygons that extend past the camera are removed.
2) object precision is object based and determines surface visibility while image percision is pixel based and looks for line visibility.

### Q1.2 Culling computing
### Q1.3 Concepts of lighting and shading
1)tactile, emission, particle, and wave models.
2)Model determines how light is drawn on the object
3) Shading model determines specular highlights and reflections on objects
4)Gouraud Shading
