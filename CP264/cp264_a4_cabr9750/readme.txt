Fill in the self-evaluation in the following evaluation grid.
Symbols: A - assignment, Q - question 
Field format: [self-evaluation/total marks/marker's evaluation]

For example, you put your self-evaluation, say 2, like [2/2/*]. 
If marker gives different evaluation value say 1, it will show 
[2/2/1] in the marking report. 

Evaluation grid: [self-evaluation/total/marker-evaluation]
